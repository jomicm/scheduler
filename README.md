# ðŸ—“ Interview Scheduler

Scheduler is an application intended to book interviews with available mentors. It has a modern looking design and was built using React library. 
You can select days and look for available spaces so you can create a new appointment or edit existing ones.

This project was built as a part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp for the purposes of practice React and extensive testing. (Static, Unit, Integration, End-to-end)
